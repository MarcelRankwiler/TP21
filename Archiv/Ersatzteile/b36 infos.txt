The most common claim is that the B 36 is assembled from two B 18 engines. The truth is that the B 36 has only a few parts in the valve system in common with the B 18. 

Scissors from a Swedish side:
I can give you some tips for I have renovated several B36 V8:or.
1: The B36's piston is similar to the B18, but the dom is not the same. The B36 pistons have an original chamfer in the skirt because there is a narrow slope on the connecting rod. The piston bolt sits either higher or lower down on the piston if compared to B18-B20.
2: The frame and bearing can be built/turned and milled yourself since it is not the same as on the B18 B20.
3: The other parts that are the same as B18 are: Valves Steering Springs Lifters and Piston Rings.


It is true that both bore and stroke are identical, but vital measures such as compression height and the length of the connecting rods (c/c) are different. The B 36 engine's tops are also of the cross flow type, while the B 18 has intake and exhaust on the same side. The B 36 is a further development of the B 8B engine that was used in the Philip prototype from the 50s. Phillip had an automatic transmission, power brakes and power steering. The car was probably too modern and large (it had 6 seats). The car is today at the Volvo Museum in Gothenburg. Volvo used the engine in a couple of light trucks in the 50s and 60s. Parts are hard to find. But there is good access to used engines, but you may have to buy a truck instead.
